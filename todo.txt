user should be able to give their own allocation functions as argv commands

example of a call to program should be something like:

ruby main.rb NAME_OF_C_FILE -af allocationFunction1 allocationFunction2 allocationFunctionN -df deallocationFunction1 deallocationFunction2 deallocationFunctionN

where flags -af is for allocation function and -df is for de-allocation function

these may be custom methods that the user has written.
